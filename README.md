Added UI with event listeners and modified javascript to feed info better to functions

Game logic has win conditions for each round but there is currently
no way to track the score. The easiest way with the current setup is
to create two values, one for computer and one for player. I will add
the logic to increment each value accordingly, then write another function
called endGame() and insert it into the for loop with an if statement in 
the function game().
